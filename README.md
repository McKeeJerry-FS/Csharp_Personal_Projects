# C# Personal Projects

This repo is the beginning of the creation of my my portfolio showcasing projects that I have created using C#. These will range from Console Games and Applications to Websites to hopefully one day incorporating projects using ASP.NET Core and possibly Unity Game Engine. 

Most of these projects are created during my own self studies using either books (mostly the APress series for C# and ASP.NET Core), Udemy courses, Codecademy, and LinkedIn Learning. I will also be incorpoarting projects that I complete during my time at *Full Sail University*. These will highlight my skill growth while I achieve my Bachelor's degree and certificates from various programs. 

My goals for this portfolio and my career is to showcase a wide variety of projects, to graduate with my Bachelor's degree, and to become certified in C# and ASP.NET.
