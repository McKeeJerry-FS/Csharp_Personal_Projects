README.md

   In this folder I am showcasing projects that I have worked oneither through *Self-study* or throughout my classes at *Full Sail University*. This will become part of a portfolio that I am in the process of planning out and am beginning to develop. The hope is to show future employers the progression of skill level as I complete each new project. I will continue to update each project and fine tune the code so that it abides by Clean Code principles as well as Agile principles as well. 
   
   So far the project the project list includes:
   
   * HighLow - a game in which you guess a number by using clues to wheter the number is higher or lower than your guess.
   * Rock, Paper, Scissors - your classic rock, paper, scissors game against the computer
   * Tic Tac Toe - the classic Tic Tac Toe game against the computer.

More projects will follow as I continue to devlop skills as well as learn and become more proficient in new C# concepts.
